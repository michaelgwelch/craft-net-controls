Desktop Developer, "Craft .NET Controls With Inheritance," by Michael Welch
Visual Studio Magazine, June 2002


Due to the space limitations of the magazine article, I have included several examples in this package.

The WindowsControl.zip file contains the code as presented in the magazine article.

The AdvanceGaugeControlVB.zip file presents a Gauge control with extra functionality. This example is in Visual Basic.

The GaugeControlCSharp.zip file presents the same Gauge control as AdvacedGaugeControlVB.zip, except the control code is in C#. The test client is still in VB (same as the VB client in AdvancedGaugeControlVB.zip).
